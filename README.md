Corkscrew (Android Application)

An android platform wine app for wine tasters where the user can search a wine by taste, popularity, and food that goes well with it, take notes about the wine, calculate Blood Alcohol Content, and save the wines in tasted list.

This is a project that I worked in a team of 10 Computer Science students at UCSD in Spring quarter of 2013
in Software Engineering course (CSE 110).
This is the very first android application that everyone on our team developed.
This app is developed targeting Android "Gingerbread" as minimum and Android "Jelly Bean" as the main target since
"Jelly Bean" was the latest Android OS at the time we were implementing this application.

Features Implemented:
- Users can search a wine by taste, popularity, and food that goes well with it
- Users can search for food and recipe that goes well with the wine they're looking for
- Users can keep track of their Blood Alcohol Content and get an alert when it goes over the legal BAC to drive a car
- Users can write reviews on the wine and share the wine with other users
- Users can also take notes on the wine that they have tasted
- Users can add wines to to-taste-list and tasted-list

Design, Technologies, and Tools:
- Eclipse
- Java
- RESTful API (HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET)
- Google App Engine
- SQLite (Local Database)
- JSON
- XML
- MVC Framework
